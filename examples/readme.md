### Immersitech Demos
To build the demos and experiment with them, simply move this examples folder to your distribution of the SDK. For example,
```
./immersitech-engage-sdk-v1.0.14-macOS-voice-only
├── docs
│   ├── ImmersitechPrivacyPolicy.pdf
│   ├── ImmersitechTermsofUse.pdf
│   └── releasenotes.txt
├── examples
│   ├── clearvoice_demo
│   └── legacy_examples
├── include
│   ├── immersitech.h
│   ├── immersitech_event_manager.h
│   └── immersitech_logger.h
├── lib
│   └── libimmersitech.dylib
└── license
    └── Immersitech_Engineering_sound_manager_license_key.dat
```
Then, simply open the XCode Project or Visual Studio solution to build the demo. As always, please feel free to [reach out](https://immersitech.io/contact/support/) if you have any questions!

### Legacy Examples
Feel free to look around at the legacy examples as well, but be aware there may be some challenges when trying to build them.
