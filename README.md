# Immersitech Engage™ Core SDK

The Immersitech SDK is a C / C++ library that allow you to easily augment your existing audio applications with several audio effects, including noise cancellation, 3D spatial audio, and voice clarity effects. Provide the library with an input audio buffer and the library will output an audio buffer with the enhanced audio. See our [developer](https://immersitech.io/developer/) page for more information.
